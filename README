# Parse-AccessLog

Parse Nginx/Apache access logs in "combined" format. Parses web server logs
created by Apache/nginx in combined format. Assumes no knowledge of the server
which creates the log entries. Does not perform any validation (i.e. IP
address, etc). This module only parses log files (and attempts to do that
well).
